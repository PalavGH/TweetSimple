This is a demo project I am using to showcase on my portfolio. However, you are free to use it however you wish. Open-Source, please feel free to make any modifications to it.

While this is primarly intended to be a demo project for me, it is also(in my opinion) a good first insight into basic API usage. As a college student, I feel as though API's
are one of the things that colleges don't really teach us. Hopefully this project will help someone learn how to use an API, message me on Discord if you need help,
